### **1. Framework**
**React 19 (Latest)**  
- Most popular and well-supported frontend library.  
- Includes new React 19 features (`use`, `useOptimistic`, `useActionState`) for better async and form handling.  
- Strong ecosystem and long-term community support.  

### **2. Build Tool**
**Vite**  
- Ultra-fast development server with hot module reload (HMR).  
- Modern and optimized production builds.  
- Simpler and faster than Create React App.  

### **3. Styling**
**Tailwind CSS v4**  
- Utility-first CSS for consistent design.  
- Speeds up UI development with prebuilt responsive utilities.  
- Built-in dark mode and accessibility-friendly classes.  

### **4. State & API Handling**
- **Axios** â†’ For making API requests to our Node.js microservices backend.  
- **Zustand** â†’ Lightweight and scalable global state management.  
- **React Context** â†’ For smaller shared states (auth, theme). 

### **5. Routing**
**React Router v7**  
- Declarative, modern routing for React apps.  
- Supports nested routes, loaders, and error handling.  

### **6. Video & Realtime**
